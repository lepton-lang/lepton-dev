# Saki-lang

Saki is a statically typed, pure functional programming language that integrates dependent types and certain object-oriented constructs, including function overloading and algebraic subtyping. Its design emphasizes simplicity, adopting a C-family syntax while employing a sophisticated type system rooted in Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory. Saki introduces novel features, such as contract universes and superposition types, positioning itself as an experimental platform for investigating advanced type system mechanics and program synthesis.
